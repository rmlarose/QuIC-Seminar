    "In this notebook, we'll introduce a class of circuits/algorithms known as **variational quantum algorithms**. Variational algorithms are a class of algorithms that may foreseeably be implemented on near term intermediate scale quantum computers, as opposed to things like Shor's factoring algorithm which require large scale, fault tolerant quantum computers. The idea is to build circuits with parameters we may vary, estimate the expectation values of those circuits, compute some cost function, and implement classical optimization algorithms so we can figure out how to vary our circuit to get closer to the true answer. Qiskit has a package (Qiskit Aqua) that does this all behind the scenes, but it's important to understand what's actually going on in the code, so we'll implement all these steps ourselves!"
